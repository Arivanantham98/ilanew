                                                    assets need wills. However, there are many good reasons to have a will.

                                        <h5>What Does a Will Cover?</h5>
                                        <p>A will allows you to direct how your belongings—such as bank balances, property,
                                            or prized possessions—should be distributed. If you have a business or
                                            investments, your will can specify who will receive those assets and when.<br>A
                                            will also allows you to direct assets to a charity (or charities) of your
                                            choice. Similarly, if you wish to leave assets to an institution or an
                                            organization, a will can assure that your wishes are carried out.<br>While wills
                                            generally address the bulk of your assets, some aren't covered by their
                                            instructions. Those omissions include payouts from the testator's life insurance
                                            policy. Since the policy has specified beneficiaries, those individuals will
                                            receive the proceeds. The same will likely apply for any investment accounts
                                            that are designated as <strong>transfer on death.</strong><br>In addition to
                                            directing your assets, a will states your preferences for who should take over
                                            as guardian for your minor children in the event of your death.</p>
                                        <h5>Wills and Trusts</h5>
                                        <p>A will is also helpful even if you have a trust—a legal mechanism that lets you
                                            put conditions on how your assets are distributed after you die and, often, to
                                            minimize gift and estate taxes. That's because most trusts deal only with
                                            specific assets, such as life insurance or a piece of property, rather than the
                                            sum total of your holdings.</p>
                                        <p>You might also consider setting up a trust as a way to provide for a beneficiary
                                            who is underage. Once the beneficiary is deemed capable of managing their
                                            assets, they will receive possession of the trust.</p>
                                        <p>Even if you have what's known as a revocable living trust into which you can put
                                            the bulk of your assets, you still need what's known as a pour-over will. In
                                            addition to letting you name a guardian for your children, a pour-over will
                                            ensure that all the assets you intended to put into the trust are put there,
                                            even if you fail to retitle some of them before your death.</p>
                                        <p>Any assets that are not retitled in the name of the trust are considered subject
                                            to probate. As a result, if you haven't specified in a will who should get those
                                            as</p>
                                        <h5>What Happens if I Don't Have a Will?</h5>
                                        <p>If you die intestate—that is, without a will—the state oversees the dispensation
                                            of your assets, which it will typically distribute according to a set formula.
                                        </p>

                                            Because of the elective-share and community property provisions mentioned above,
                                            the formula often results in half of your estate going to your spouse and the
                                            other half going to your children. Such a scenario sometimes results in the sale
                                            of the family home or other assets, which can negatively affect a surviving
                                            spouse who may have counted on the bulk of your assets to maintain their
                                            standard of living.
                                            Further complications may ensue if your children are minors, as the court will
                                            appoint a representative to look after their interests.
